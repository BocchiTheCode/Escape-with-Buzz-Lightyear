# Escape-with-Buzz-Lightyear
A text based game like Zork but on a smaller scale, made using Python and Django. To run this game on your system you would need the software mentioned in requirements.txt.
After setting that up, go to the adv folder with a file named manage.py. Now open a terminal from that directory and type in the following command-


python manage.py runserver (and that's it!)
